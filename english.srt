1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,780
Alice Rondo-san.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,000
Here!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,540
Chloe Aubert-san.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,370
Here.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,210
Okay, everyone's here.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,790
As I told you previously,

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,450
I'll be leaving Freedom Academy
at the end of the current term.

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,900
Sensei...

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,360
Hey, don't look so sad.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,460
I'll come back to visit all the time.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,750
Hmph. Don't bother.

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,340
Yeah! It'll be a relief to have you gone!

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,220
What's with the tough act?

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,340
You guys just can't be
honest with yourselves.

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,550
Rimuru-sensei, you really
will come visit, right?

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,440
Yeah, of course.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,560
That said, we still have more
than a month left until then.

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,460
Also, you guys still have your
finals to get through first,

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
so you'd better study hard!

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,760
Ugh, finals?

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,570
Rimuru-sensei, I'm here.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Oh, time for Tiss-sensei's class.

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,460
Come on in.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,290
You guys better not make any
trouble for Tiss-sensei, you hear?

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,760
We wouldn't make any trouble.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
Tiss-sensei traveled to Guratol with us.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,300
We have a pretty tight bond with her now.

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,800
Yes, they're all great kids.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,990
Great kids, huh?

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,780
Okay, Tiss-sensei, they're all yours.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,180
Sure.

32
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,460
What're you going to do, Rimuru-sensei?

33
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,810
Take a nap or something, I bet.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,210
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

35
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,900
Alice-kun, despite appearances,
I have quite a lot of work to do!

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,770
Until next time, everyone!

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,270
See you later, Rimuru-sensei!

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,230
All right, let's start class.

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,180
Yes, ma'am!

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Looks like she's getting
along pretty well with them.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,880
Yes.

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,790
I guess this means I can count on
Tiss-sensei to take over for me.

43
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,880
Well, then...

44
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,710
Yes, I'm very busy.

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,140
Not only do I have the kids of
Freedom Academy to look after,

46
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,890
but I also have lots to do for
Tempest, our nation of monsters.

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,180
Which means

48
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,260
the Spatial Movement skill I got by analyzing
that air spirit sure is coming in handy.

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,410
Yep, looks like another
peaceful day in Tempest.

50
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,920
I'm Rimuru Tempest, and I'm a slime.

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,900
When I was a human, I was
stabbed in a random attack,

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,840
and I thought I had died...

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,550
but I reincarnated in this world as a slime.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,830
I became friends with the
Storm Dragon, Veldora...

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,960
I built a nation of monsters...

56
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,140
And I fought to protect everyone in it.

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,770
Shizu-san's lingering regret...

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,660
was those kids,

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,320
and I succeeded in saving them.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,030
Now we can rest easy.

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,160
My time as a teacher is almost over now.

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,330
There sure have been lots of ups and downs,

63
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,110
and a lot of pretty tough times, but now...

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,440
You know, Ranga, I hope this
peace will last forever.

65
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,300
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime

66
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,970
Episode 25:  Rimuru's Busy Life

67
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,270
I got involved in a bit of a mess
with the Demon Lord Carrion,

68
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,780
but then we signed a non-aggression
pact, ending all hostilities between us.

69
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,840
Then I accepted Carrion's proposal

70
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,060
that the Jura Tempest Federation
and the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania

71
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,770
Jura Tempest Federation

72
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,770
Animal Kingdom
of Eurazania

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,770
should each send out delegations
to the other country.

74
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,680
I appointed Benimaru to lead our delegation,

75
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,780
with Rigur as his assistant.

76
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,190
Rigur has grown into such a fine man!

77
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,970
Today is the momentous day upon
which our delegation departs,

78
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,290
and I'm back in Tempest to see them off.

79
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,220
Hmm, not bad.

80
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,050
Urgh... This shape is kinda hard to hold...

81
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,520
Great Rimuru, thank you for waiting.

82
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,940
We've selected some ceremonial
outfits for you to choose from.

83
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,550
Th-Thanks!

84
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess I'll try them on right now.

85
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,420
I don't think this is quite right...

86
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,130
Then how about this one?

87
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,630
Huh?! I don't know about this one, either...

88
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,300
I recommend this one!

89
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,070
You look fantastic, Great Rimuru!

90
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,060
It suits you perfectly!

91
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,310
Listen, Shuna, Shion...

92
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,940
I think something more somber and
respectful would be more appropriate.

93
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,010
More somber and respectful?

94
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,320
This delegation is important
to the future of Tempest.

95
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,700
I want to send them off right.

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,630
I see!

97
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,460
We do have some things that
are somber and respectful.

98
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,010
Hey, it's starting.

99
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,510
Great Rimuru!

100
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,920
Great Rimuru looks amazing!
Doesn't he, Gobzo?!

101
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,630
Y-You look great!

102
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,510
So do you, Sir Gabiru!

103
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,120
Indeed!

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,190
Not bad.

105
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,680
Master, you look splendid!

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,780
Everyone, be silent!

107
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,790
I wish you all the best in
carrying out this mission.

108
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,840
That's it?

109
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,740
Was that too short?!

110
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,390
Okay, I'll add a bit more.

111
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Tempest has grown vastly more
prosperous than it was before,

112
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,690
but it is still inexperienced as a nation.

113
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,990
If we can build a favorable
relationship with Eurazania,

114
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,410
we can find ways to utilize the
things that make their nation great,

115
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,740
which will help our own nation
progress even further.

116
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,200
However...

117
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,370
The Eastern Plains

118
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,410
The Demon Lord Carrion, ruler of Eurazania,

119
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,250
The Western Provinces

120
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Tempest

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Winged Nation
of Fulbrosia

122
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Animal Kingdom
of Eurazania

123
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Kusha Mountains

124
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Ameld River

125
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,040
also known as the Beastmaster,
is a hardcore militant type.

126
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,010
He might be thinking, "Power is everything!"

127
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,030
If it looks like a fight's about to
break out, come straight back here.

128
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,020
Our goal is not to fight.

129
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,220
It's to find out if our
nations can get along,

130
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,320
or if we need to sever relations with them.

131
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,540
Although this is for the good of Tempest,

132
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,310
you don't need to force yourself
to endure any more than necessary.

133
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,810
I'm counting on you!

134
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,990
Yes, sir!

135
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,930
Great Rimuru! I'm so moved!

136
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,740
There, there...

137
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,030
I should be the one going
out there, to be honest.

138
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,060
No, until we confirm that it is safe,

139
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,710
I believe you should refrain from
entering a Demon Lord's domain.

140
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,730
I will discern with my own eyes whether or
not the Demon Lord Carrion can be trusted.

141
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,460
Thanks.

142
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,970
Remember, whatever you do,
don't go picking a fight.

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,660
No need to worry.

144
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,060
So reliable! Benimaru's really grown up!

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,520
Good luck to you guys, too, Rigur.

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,060
Thank you. I will gain as
much experience as I can.

147
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,870
We'll be on our way now.

148
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,670
Have fun, you guys!

149
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,250
Take care!

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,830
Good luck!

151
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,820
Be safe, Brother!

152
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,820
Good luck, everyone!

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,830
The first steps toward
hope for our future, huh?

154
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,650
Here's hoping we can establish
formal diplomatic relations

155
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,070
and help both of our nations grow even more.

156
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,000
Thus the first delegation from
our nation set out on its way.

157
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,600
And we have to get things ready here at home
to welcome Eurazania's delegation, too.

158
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,710
Good, good. Looks like the reception
hall will be ready in time.

159
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,610
How are the chefs doing?

160
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,110
Just fine.

161
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,720
Princess Shuna is teaching them.

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,550
They're all quick learners
and coming along well.

163
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,100
Yes... I think it could
use just a bit more salt.

164
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,320
As for the reception hall waiting staff,

165
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,630
Vesta is giving them guidance.

166
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,410
I guess proper etiquette
is kind of his forte.

167
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,130
We can always count on an actual noble.

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,750
And, um... also...

169
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,140
The date for your visit to the
Armed Nation of Dwargon has been set.

170
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,310
Oh, yeah. I need to see King Gazel in person

171
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,140
to thank him again for establishing
diplomatic relations with Tempest.

172
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,400
He's probably not too happy with Milim's
involvement in the Charybdis incident,

173
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,440
so I need to explain that, too.

174
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,160
Treyni-san!

175
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Greetings, Great Rimuru.

176
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,730
What brings you here? Has something happened?

177
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,770
Yes.

178
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,550
The delegation from the Animal Kingdom of
Eurazania has entered the Great Forest of Jura.

179
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,920
I wanted to inform you.

180
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,460
Ah, so they're almost here.

181
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,840
They should arrive here in
Tempest within five days.

182
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,800
Thanks for letting me know!

183
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,440
It was the least I could do.

184
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,750
Also, it is likely that they will
arrive before the delegation does.

185
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,110
"They"?

186
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,670
Yes, the champion's...

187
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,970
It's getting dark. Let's go home.

188
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,910
Okay!

189
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,020
Mush, mush, mush...

190
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,700
Mush!

191
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,710
How cute!

192
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,300
Don't move!

193
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,700
Youm and his buddies.

194
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,350
They used to be a gang of ruffians,

195
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,770
but I had them become the champions who
defeated the Orc Lord in our place.

196
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Wow...

197
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,220
If it got out that we defeated the Orc Lord,

198
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,880
it would just make humans wary of us.

199
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,570
Are you all right?

200
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,740
Y-Yes... Thank you so much.

201
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,710
Um... Thank you.

202
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,500
Better be careful. There are
some nasty monsters around here.

203
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,000
Your sword is so cool!

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,110
I know, right?

205
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,890
I had it made in a nation of good monsters
called Tempest that's just ahead.

206
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,760
They're traveling around telling people
everywhere that we're friendly monsters.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,890
And from then on...

208
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,080
I continued to keep busy every day...

209
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,560
right up until the day we welcomed
the delegation from Eurazania.

210
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,190
Wow, this is good.

211
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,830
It really is. I've never had it before.

212
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,910
Right? It's called brandy.

213
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,530
Brandy, you say?

214
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,540
I made it as a special treat
since we have guests visiting.

215
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,960
Oh, yeah? Guests?

216
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Yep. The Demon Lord Carrion's
delegation is arriving tomorrow.

217
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,510
Did you do that on purpose?!

218
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,350
The Demon Lord Carrion?!
How the hell did that happen?!

219
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,620
Well, it's a long story...

220
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,100
This feels so nice.

221
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,110
I see.

222
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,620
So it's our chance to establish
diplomatic relations.

223
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,490
I get it.

224
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,910
A Demon Lord, though? Really?

225
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,650
Sounds like that's gonna
be one scary delegation.

226
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,870
I don't know about that.
The goal isn't to fight.

227
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,590
But you sent Benimaru just in case
the unforeseen happens, right?

228
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,510
Wouldn't they have the same idea?

229
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,970
If they do, it doesn't matter.

230
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,840
I don't want to make a wrong
move and waste this chance.

231
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,720
Yeah, I guess not.

232
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,850
You guys better not pick any fights
with the delegates, either.

233
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey, c'mon, Master.
My boys and I aren't complete morons.

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Right?

235
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,220
You said it.

236
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,610
That's good, then.

237
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,450
By the way, Hakurou was hoping to see you.

238
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,820
The master?!

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,620
He wanted to make sure
you haven't gotten rusty.

240
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,040
Well, that sobered me right up.

241
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,270
Then, the next day...

242
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Here they come.

243
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,770
Horse-drawn carriages?

244
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,820
No, those are tigers...
Tiger-drawn carriages?

245
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,320
They look like war chariots.

246
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,210
They're no big deal.

247
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,160
In the face of your mighty power,
that doesn't even work as a bluff.

248
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,640
Wait, wait, wait, Shion-san!
They're definitely a big deal!

249
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,750
All those fancy decorations
have no purpose in combat.

250
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,170
Wait, wait, wait, Shion-san!

251
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,340
We're not talking about combat here!

252
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,440
It is a pleasure to meet you,

253
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,480
leader of the Jura Tempest
Federation, Rimuru Tempest.

254
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,110
I am Albis, the Golden Serpent,

255
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,870
Animal Kingdom of Eurazania  Three Beastketeers
The Golden Serpent  Albis

256
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,860
one of the Demon Lord Carrion's
Three Beastketeers.

257
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,380
Wow, he sent his highest-ranking
subordinates?

258
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,740
You gotta be kidding!

259
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,340
I came along 'cause I wondered what kind
of monster the leader of Tempest was,

260
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,260
Animal Kingdom of Eurazania  Three Beastketeers
The White Tiger Claw  Suphia

261
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,590
and you're just a wussy, little slime?

262
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,130
If you wanna screw with us,
you can only take it so far!

263
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,960
Wow, that one looks pretty strong, too.

264
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,600
Stand down, Suphia.

265
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,620
You may as well be slinging mud
directly onto Lord Carrion's face.

266
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,140
Oh, shut up, Albis.
You can't order me around.

267
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,440
Besides, Dwarves are one thing,

268
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,360
but humans, too?

269
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,900
Anyone who pals around with
puny, insolent, cowardly humans

270
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,950
is a disgrace to all monsters!

271
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,660
That's quite the take.

272
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,120
Youm here is my friend,

273
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,160
as well as a fellow student under
the same master who taught me.

274
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,790
Yeah? So what?

275
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,790
Hey, Youm...

276
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,760
It bugs you to know she just
made fun of you, doesn't it?

277
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,470
Why don't you show her what
you can do? I'll allow it.

278
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,350
Whoa, hang on! Weren't we
gonna be peaceful about this?!

279
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,960
I wasn't planning to start any fights,

280
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,850
but if the other side does,
that's another matter.

281
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,510
Oh? You wanna play, human?

282
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,810
Uh, I...

283
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,160
Go get 'er, boss!

284
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,650
We can't let her make us look like losers!

285
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,470
Please do the honors, Youm!

286
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,700
All right, fine.

287
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,080
Master, be sure to clean up
the mess when I'm done, okay?

288
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,160
Hah! You're asking a slime
to clean up the mess?

289
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,380
Don't make me laugh!

290
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,970
Sure, I'll take care of... it?

291
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,470
Um... Shion-san?

292
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,280
All she's done since she arrived
is hurl insults toward you.

293
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,480
I've put up with it all this time,

294
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,150
but it looks like there
was never any need to!

295
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,690
Huh?

296
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,980
Wha... um...

297
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,290
It's me you'll be fighting.

298
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,490
Oh?

299
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,680
You wanna fight bare-handed, eh?

300
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,520
Sounds fun!

301
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,230
Is Shion gonna be okay?

302
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,990
She's fighting on her opponent's
terms, without her sword.

303
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,410
Don't worry, Great Rimuru.

304
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,410
Shion is almost as strong as my brother.

305
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,850
R-Really?

306
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,540
Honestly, what are we going
to do with that Suphia?

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,150
Grucius.

308
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,790
Go and deal with that human.

309
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,960
Ugh.

310
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,350
Just because I'm the runt
in the Beastketeers,

311
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,220
Beast King's Beastketeers  Runt
Grucius

312
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,240
I have to fight a human?

313
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,720
Fine, I'll play with you...

314
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
human.

315
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,000
Great. Thanks.

316
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,450
Man, Youm's pretty good.

317
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,000
Grucius is a majin, and they're
actually on even footing.

318
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes, he's fighting magnificently.

319
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,420
Hakurou's training is really paying off!

320
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,380
Damn, boss, not bad!

321
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,170
That's a champion for ya!

322
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,260
I wasn't expecting you to be this much fun!

323
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,700
Don't underestimate me, Lycanthrope.

324
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,060
The power of a Kijin can rend the
heavens and shatter the earth!

325
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,980
I'll show you that right now!

326
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,720
Great! Show me!

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,200
Entertain me even more!

328
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,460
Thus, immediately after the
delegation from Eurazania arrived,

329
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,030
a ferocious battle broke out.

330
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,720
Of course, I was the one who instigated it.

331
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,090
Next time, "Trade with the Animal Kingdom."

332
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,980
Trade with the Animal Kingdom
